import RequiredLabel from '@site/src/components/Docs/RequiredLabel';

The `vault.yml` configuration file _is not required_ but can be used to define additional metadata
for a project, override inherited tasks, and more at the project-level. When used, this file must
exist in a project's root, as configured in [`projects`](../tutorial-basics/markdown-features).

```yaml title="vault.yml"
$schema: 'https://vaultrepo.dev/schemas/project.json'
```

## `dependsOn`

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

Explicitly defines _other_ projects that _this_ project depends on, primarily when generating the
project and task graphs. The most common use case for this is building those projects _before_
building this one. When defined, this setting requires an array of project names, which are the keys
found in the [`projects`](../tutorial-basics/markdown-features) map.

```yaml title="vault.yml"
dependsOn:
  - 'apiClients'
  - 'designSystem'
```

A dependency object can also be defined, where a specific `scope` can be assigned, which accepts
"production" (default), "development", or "peer".

```yaml title="vault.yml"
dependsOn:
  - id: 'apiClients'
    scope: 'production'
  - id: 'designSystem'
    scope: 'peer'
```

## Metadata

## `language`

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

The primary programming language the project is written in. This setting is required for
[task inheritance](../tutorial-basics/markdown-features), editor extensions, and more. Supports the following values:

- `bash` - A [Bash](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)>) based project (Unix only).
- `batch` - A [Batch](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Windows_Batch_Scripting)/PowerShell based
  project (Windows only).
- `go` - A [Go](https://go.dev/) based project.
- `javascript` - A [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) based
  project.
- `php` - A [PHP](https://www.php.net) based project.
- `python` - A [Python](https://www.python.org/) based project.
- `ruby` - A [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) based project.
- `rust` - A [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) based project.
- `typescript` - A [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) based project.
- `unknown` (default) - When not configured or inferred.
- `*` - A custom language. Values will be converted to kebab-case.

```yaml title="vault.yml"
language: 'javascript'

# Custom
language: 'kotlin'
```

> For convenience, when this setting is not defined, vault will attempt to detect the language based
> on configuration files found in the project root. This only applies to non-custom languages!

## `project`

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

The `project` setting defines metadata about the project itself.

```yaml title="vault.yml"
project:
  name: 'vault'
  description: 'A monorepo management tool.'
  channel: '#vault'
  owner: 'infra.platform'
  maintainers: ['miles.johnson']
```

The information listed within `project` is purely informational and primarily displayed within the
CLI. However, this setting exists for you, your team, and your company, as a means to identify and
organize all projects. Feel free to build your own tooling around these settings!

### `channel`

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

The Slack, Discord, Teams, IRC, etc channel name (with leading #) in which to discuss the project.

### `description`<RequiredLabel />

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

A description of what the project does and aims to achieve. Be as descriptive as possible, as this
is the kind of information search engines would index on.

### `maintainers`

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

A list of people/developers that maintain the project, review code changes, and can provide support.
Can be a name, email, LDAP name, GitHub username, etc, the choice is yours.

### `name`

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

A human readable name of the project. This is _different_ from the unique project name configured in
[`projects`](../tutorial-basics/markdown-features).

### `owner`

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

The team or organization that owns the project. Can be a title, LDAP name, GitHub team, etc. We
suggest _not_ listing people/developers as the owner, use [maintainers](#maintainers) instead.

## `tags`

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

Tags are a simple mechanism for categorizing projects. They can be used to group projects together
for [easier querying](../tutorial-basics/markdown-features), enforcing of
[project boundaries and constraints](../tutorial-basics/markdown-features),
[task inheritance](../tutorial-basics/markdown-features), and more.

```yaml title="vault.yml"
tags:
  - 'react'
  - 'prisma'
```

## `type`

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

The type of project. Supports the following values:

- `application` - A backend, frontend, or CLI application.
- `library` - A self-contained, shareable, and publishable set of code.
- `tool` - An internal tool, one-off script, etc.
- `unknown` (default) - When not configured.

```yaml title="vault.yml"
type: 'application'
```

> Project type is used in task inheritance, constraints and boundaries, editor extensions, and more!

## Tasks

## `env`

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

The `env` field is map of strings that are passed as environment variables to _all tasks_ within the
current project. Project-level variables will not override task-level variables of the same name.

```yaml title="vault.yml" {1,2}
env:
  NODE_ENV: 'production'
```

> View the task [`env`](#env-1) setting for more usage examples and information.

## `fileGroups`

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

Defines [file groups](../tutorial-basics/markdown-features) to be used by local tasks. By default, this setting
_is not required_ for the following reasons:

- File groups are an optional feature, and are designed for advanced use cases.
- File groups defined in [`.vault/tasks.yml`](../tutorial-basics/markdown-features) will be inherited by all projects.

When defined this setting requires a map, where the key is the file group name, and the value is a
list of [globs or paths](../tutorial-basics/markdown-features). Globs and paths are
[relative to a project](../tutorial-basics/markdown-features) (even when defined
[globally](../tutorial-basics/markdown-features).

```yaml title="vault.yml"
fileGroups:
  configs:
    - '*.config.{js,cjs,mjs}'
    - '*.json'
  sources:
    - 'src/**/*'
    - 'types/**/*'
  tests:
    - 'tests/**/*'
    - '**/__tests__/**/*'
  assets:
    - 'assets/**/*'
    - 'images/**/*'
    - 'static/**/*'
    - '**/*.{scss,css}'
```

> The code snippet above is merely an example of file groups. Feel free to use those groups as-is,
> modify the glob lists, add and remove groups, or implement completely new groups. The choice is
> yours!

## `platform`

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

The default [`platform`](#platform-1) for all task's within the current project. When a task's
`platform` has _not been_ explicitly configured, the platform will fallback to this configured
value, otherwise the platform will be detected from the project's environment.

```yaml title="vault.yml"
platform: 'node'
```

## `tasks`

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

Tasks are actions that are ran within the context of a [project](../tutorial-basics/markdown-features), and commonly
wrap an npm binary or system command. This setting requires a map, where the key is a unique name
for the task, and the value is an object of task parameters.

```yaml title="vault.yml"
tasks:
  format:
    command: 'prettier'
  lint:
    command: 'eslint'
  test:
    command: 'jest'
  typecheck:
    command: 'tsc'
```

### `command`<RequiredLabel />

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

The `command` field is the command line to run for the task, including the command name (must be
first) and any optional [arguments](#args). This field is required when _not_ inheriting a global
task of the same name.

```yaml title="vault.yml" {3}
tasks:
  format:
    # Using a string
    command: 'prettier --check .'
    # Using an array
    command:
      - 'prettier'
      - '--check'
      - '.'
```

By default a task assumes the command name is an npm binary, and if you'd like to reference a system
command, you'll also need to set the [`platform`](#platform) to "system". We do our best to
automatically detect this, but it's not accurate in all scenarios.

```yaml title="vault.yml"
tasks:
  clean:
    command: 'rm -rf ./dist'
    platform: 'system'
```

#### Special commands

For interoperability reasons, the following command names have special handling.

- `noop`, `no-op`, `nop` - Marks the task as a "no operation". Will not execute a command in the
  action pipeline but can define dependencies.
- When `platform` is "deno":
  - Will execute with `deno` binary.
- When `platform` is "node":
  - `node`, `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn` - Uses the binaries from the toolchain.

### `args`

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

The `args` field is a collection of _additional_ arguments to pass to the command line when
executing the task. This field exists purely to provide arguments for
[inherited tasks](../tutorial-basics/markdown-features).

This setting can be defined using a string, or an array of strings. We suggest using arrays when
dealing with many args, or the args string cannot be parsed easily.

```yaml title="vault.yml" {4,5}
tasks:
  test:
    command: 'jest'
    # Using a string
    args: '--color --maxWorkers 3'
    # Using an array
    args:
      - '--color'
      - '--maxWorkers'
      - '3'
```

However, for the array approach to work correctly, each argument _must_ be its own distinct item,
including argument values. For example:

```yaml title="vault.yml"
tasks:
  test:
    command: 'jest'
    args:
      # Valid
      - '--maxWorkers'
      - '3'
      # Also valid
      - '--maxWorkers=3'
      # Invalid
      - '--maxWorkers 3'
```

### `deps`

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

The `deps` field is a list of other tasks (known as [targets](../tutorial-basics/markdown-features), either within
this project or found in another project, that will be executed _before_ this task. It achieves this
by generating a directed task graph based on the project graph.

```yaml title="vault.yml" {4-6}
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'webpack'
    deps:
      - 'apiClients:build'
      - 'designSystem:build'
      # A task within the current project
      - 'codegen'
```

### `env`

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

The `env` field is map of strings that are passed as environment variables when running the command.
Variables defined here will take precedence over those loaded with [`envFile`](#envfile).

```yaml title="vault.yml" {4,5}
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'webpack'
    env:
      NODE_ENV: 'production'
```

Variables also support substitution using the syntax `${VAR_NAME}`. When using substitution, only
variables in the current process can be referenced, and not those currently defined in `env`.

```yaml title="vault.yml" {4,5}
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'webpack'
    env:
      APP_TARGET: '${REGION}-${ENVIRONMENT}'
```

### `inputs`

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

The `inputs` field is a list of sources that calculate whether to execute this task based on the
environment and files that have been touched since the last time the task has been ran. If _not_
defined or inherited, then all files within a project are considered an input (`**/*`).

Inputs support the following source types:

- Environment variables (must start with a `$`)
- Files, folders, globs
  ([project and workspace relative file patterns](../tutorial-basics/markdown-features)

```yaml title="vault.yml" {4-10}
tasks:
  lint:
    command: 'eslint'
    inputs:
      # Config files anywhere within the project
      - '**/.eslintignore'
      - '**/.eslintrc.js'
      # Config files at the workspace root
      - '/.eslintignore'
      - '/.eslintrc.js'
      # Environment variables
      - '$ESLINT_CACHE'
```

:::caution

When using an environment variable, we assume _it's not defined_ by default, and will trigger an
affected state when it _is_ defined. If the environment variable always exists, then the task will
always run and bypass the cache.

:::

:::danger

When using globs, be aware that files that match the glob, but are ignored via `.gitignore` (or
similar), will _not_ be considered an input. To work around this, use explicit file inputs.

:::

### `local`

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

Marks the task as local only. This should primarily be enabled for long-running or never-ending
tasks, like development servers and watch mode. Defaults to `true` if the task name is "dev",
"start", or "serve", and `false` otherwise.

This is a convenience setting for local development that sets the following task options:

- [`cache`](#cache) -> Turned off
- [`outputStyle`](#outputstyle) -> Set to "stream"
- [`runInCI`](#runinci) -> Turned off

```yaml title="vault.yml" {5}
tasks:
  dev:
    command: 'webpack server'
    local: true
```

### `outputs`

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

The `outputs` field is a list of files and folders (using
[project relative file patterns](../tutorial-basics/markdown-features) that are _created_ as a
result of executing this task, typically from a build or compilation related task. Outputs are
necessary for [incremental caching and hydration](../tutorial-basics/markdown-features). If you'd prefer to avoid that
functionality, omit this field.

```yaml title="vault.yml" {4-6}
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'webpack'
    outputs:
      # Relative from project root
      - 'build/'
```

Globs can also be used if you'd like to restrict which files are cached. For example, when building
a JavaScript project, you may want to include `.js` files, but exclude `.map` and other files.

```yaml title="vault.yml" {4,5}
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'webpack'
    outputs:
      - 'build/**/*.js'
```

:::caution

When using globs and vault hydrates an output (a cache hit), all files not matching the glob will be
**deleted**. Ensure that all files critical for the build to function correctly are included.

:::

### `platform`

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

The `platform` field defines the platform (language runtime) the command runs on, where to locate
its executable, and which tool to execute it with. By default vault will set to a value based on the
project's [`language`](#language) or default [`platform`](#platform).

- `deno` - Command is executed with Deno.
- `node` - Command is a binary within `node_modules` and will be executed with Node.js.
- `system` - Command is expected to exist within the system's environment / user's shell.
- `unknown` - When not configured or inferred.

```yaml title="vault.yml" {4}
tasks:
  env:
    command: 'printenv'
    platform: 'system'
```

> This field exists because of our [toolchain](../tutorial-basics/markdown-features), and vault ensuring the correct
> command is ran.

### `options`

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

The `options` field is an object of configurable options that can be used to modify the task and its
execution. The following fields can be provided, with merge related fields supporting all
[merge strategies](../tutorial-basics/markdown-features).

```yaml title="vault.yml" {6-8}
tasks:
  typecheck:
    command: 'tsc --noEmit'
    options:
      mergeArgs: 'replace'
      runFromWorkspaceRoot: true
```

#### `affectedFiles`

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

When enabled and the [`--affected` option](../tutorial-basics/markdown-features) is
provided, all affected files that match this task's [`inputs`](#inputs) will be passed as relative
file paths as command line arguments, and as a `vault_AFFECTED_FILES` environment variable. If there
are no affected files, `.` (current directory) will be passed instead for arguments, and an empty
value for the environment variable.

```yaml title="vault.yml" {6}
tasks:
  lint:
    command: 'eslint'
    options:
      affectedFiles: true
      # Only pass args
      affectedFiles: 'args'
      # Only set env var
      affectedFiles: 'env'
```

:::caution

When using this option, ensure that explicit files or `.` _are not present_ in the [`args`](#args)
list. Furthermore, this functionality will only work if the task's command supports an arbitrary
list of files being passed as arguments.

:::

#### `cache`

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

Whether to cache the task's execution result using our [smart hashing](../tutorial-basics/markdown-features)
system. If disabled, _will not_ create a cache hash, and _will not_ persist a task's
[outputs](#outputs). Defaults to `true`.

We suggest disabling caching when defining cleanup tasks, one-off scripts, or file system heavy
operations.

```yaml title="vault.yml" {6}
tasks:
  clean:
    command: 'rm -rf ./temp'
    options:
      cache: false
```

#### `envFile`

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

A boolean or path to a `.env` file (also know as dotenv file) that defines a collection of
[environment variables](#env-1) for the current task. Variables will be loaded on project creation,
but will _not_ override those defined in [`env`](#env-1).

Variables defined in the file support value substitution/expansion by wrapping the variable name in
curly brackets, such as `${VAR_NAME}`.

```yaml title="vault.yml" {6}
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'webpack'
    options:
      # Defaults to .env
      envFile: true
      # Or
      envFile: '.env.production'
      # Or from the workspace root
      envFile: '/.env.shared'
```

:::caution

File parsing is done using the Rust [`dotenvy`](https://crates.io/crates/dotenvy) crate, which is
_different_ than the Node.js [`dotenv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package. The biggest
differences are around quote handling and variable substitution, so be aware of this!

:::

#### `mergeArgs`

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

The [strategy](../tutorial-basics/markdown-features) list with
an inherited task. Defaults to "append".

#### `mergeDeps`

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

The [strategy](../tutorial-basics/markdown-features) list with
an inherited task. Defaults to "append".

#### `mergeEnv`

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

The [strategy](../tutorial-basics/markdown-features) map with
an inherited task. Defaults to "append".

#### `mergeInputs`

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

The [strategy](../tutorial-basics/markdown-features) list
with an inherited task. Defaults to "append".

#### `mergeOutputs`

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

The [strategy](../tutorial-basics/markdown-features) list
with an inherited task. Defaults to "append".

#### `outputStyle`

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

Controls how stdout/stderr is displayed when the task is ran as a _transitive target_. By default,
this setting is not defined and defers to the action pipeline, but can be overridden with one of the
following values:

- `buffer` - Buffers output and displays after the task has exited (either success or failure).
- `buffer-only-failure` - Like `buffer`, but only displays on failures.

- `hash` - Ignores output and only displays the generated [hash](../tutorial-basics/markdown-features).

- `none` - Ignores output.
- `stream` - Streams output directly to the terminal. Will prefix each line of output with the
  target.

```yaml title="vault.yml" {5}
tasks:
  test:
    # ...
    options:
      outputStyle: 'stream'
```

#### `retryCount`

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

The number of attempts the task will retry execution before returning a failure. This is especially
useful for flaky tasks. Defaults to `0`.

```yaml title="vault.yml" {5}
tasks:
  test:
    # ...
    options:
      retryCount: 3
```

#### `runDepsInParallel`

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

Whether to run the task's [`deps`](#deps) in parallel or serial (in order). Defaults to `true`.

```yaml title="vault.yml" {8}
tasks:
  start:
    # ...
    deps:
      - '~:clean'
      - '~:build'
    options:
      runDepsInParallel: false
```

#### `runInCI`

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

Whether to run the task automatically in a CI (continuous integration) environment when affected by
touched files, typically through the [`vault ci`](../tutorial-basics/markdown-features) command. Defaults to `true` unless
the [`local`](#local) setting is disabled, but is _always_ true when a task defines
[`outputs`](#outputs).

```yaml title="vault.yml" {5}
tasks:
  build:
    # ...
    options:
      runInCI: false
```

#### `runFromWorkspaceRoot`

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

Whether to use the workspace root as the working directory when executing a task. Defaults to
`false` and runs from the task's project root.

```yaml title="vault.yml" {5}
tasks:
  typecheck:
    # ...
    options:
      runFromWorkspaceRoot: true
```

#### `shell`

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

For [system tasks](#platform-1), whether to run the command within a shell or not. Defaults to
`true`.

- On Unix, will derive the shell from the `SHELL` environment variable, or default to `/bin/sh`. The
  shell will be ran using the `-c` option.
- On Windows, will use `pwsh.exe` or `powershell.exe`. The shell will be ran using the `-Command`
  option, coupled with `-`, so that args are passed via stdin.

```yaml title="vault.yml" {3-5}
tasks:
  native:
    command: 'echo $SHELL'
    options:
      shell: true
```

If you'd like to use a different shell, or customize the shell's arguments, you can set `shell` to
false and configure a fully qualified command.

```yaml title="vault.yml" {3-5}
tasks:
  native:
    command: '/bin/zsh -c "echo $SHELL"'
    options:
      shell: false
```

## Overrides

Dictates how a project interacts with settings defined at the top-level.

## `toolchain`

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

### `node`

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

Configures Node.js for this project and overrides the top-level [`node`](../tutorial-basics/markdown-features) setting.
Currently, only the Node.js version can be overridden per-project, not the package manager.

#### `version`

Defines the explicit Node.js version to use when _running tasks_ for this project.

```yaml title="vault.yml" {2,3}
toolchain:
  node:
    version: '12.12.0'
```

### `typescript`

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

#### `disabled`

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

Disables [TypeScript support](../tutorial-basics/markdown-features) entirely for this project. Defaults to
`false`.

```yaml title="vault.yml" {2}
toolchain:
  typescript:
    disabled: true
```

#### `routeOutDirToCache`

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

Overrides the workspace-level [`routeOutDirToCache`](../tutorial-basics/markdown-features) setting.
Defaults to undefined.

```yaml title="vault.yml" {2}
toolchain:
  typescript:
    routeOutDirToCache: false
```

#### `syncProjectReferences`

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

Overrides the workspace-level [`syncProjectReferences`](../tutorial-basics/markdown-features) setting.
Defaults to undefined.

```yaml title="vault.yml" {2}
toolchain:
  typescript:
    syncProjectReferences: false
```

#### `syncProjectReferencesToPaths`

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

Overrides the workspace-level
[`syncProjectReferencesToPaths`](../tutorial-basics/markdown-features) setting. Defaults to
undefined.

```yaml title="vault.yml" {2}
toolchain:
  typescript:
    syncProjectReferencesToPaths: false
```

## `workspace`

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

### `inheritedTasks`

<HeadingApiLink to="/docs/sdk-docs/abcd#metadata" />

Provides a layer of control when inheriting tasks from [`.vault/tasks.yml`](../tutorial-basics/markdown-features).

#### `exclude`

The optional `exclude` setting permits a project to exclude specific tasks from being inherited. It
accepts a list of strings, where each string is the name of a global task to exclude.

```yaml title="vault.yml" {4}
workspace:
  inheritedTasks:
    # Exclude the inherited `test` task for this project
    exclude: ['test']
```

> Exclusion is applied after inclusion and before renaming.

#### `include`

The optional `include` setting permits a project to _only_ include specific inherited tasks (works
like an allow/white list). It accepts a list of strings, where each string is the name of a global
task to include.

When this field is not defined, the project will inherit all tasks from the global project config.

```yaml title="vault.yml" {4,7-9}
workspace:
  inheritedTasks:
    # Include *no* tasks (works like a full exclude)
    include: []

    # Only include the `lint` and `test` tasks for this project
    include:
      - 'lint'
      - 'test'
```

> Inclusion is applied before exclusion and renaming.

#### `rename`

The optional `rename` setting permits a project to rename the inherited task within the current
project. It accepts a map of strings, where the key is the original name (found in the global
project config), and the value is the new name to use.

For example, say we have 2 tasks in the global project config called `buildPackage` and
`buildApplication`, but we only need 1, and since we're an application, we should omit and rename.

```yaml title="vault.yml" {4,5}
workspace:
  inheritedTasks:
    exclude: ['buildPackage']
    rename:
      buildApplication: 'build'
```

> Renaming occurs after inclusion and exclusion.
